Started using in our eekly team meetings as well and our core group really had become passionate about our Friday meetings because we all get to get a little glimps into what makes each other tick and some insight into how we're each hardwired. Plus it's a lot of fun. Comes in a sturdy box that makes it easy for travel too. Age range I would say it's for 18 and up for developmental work purposes. Younger <br/>people could play but not having as much life experience to answer as <br/>intended would just make it a fun game. Highly recommended for team <br/>building.</p>",
